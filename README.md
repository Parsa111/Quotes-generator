This JavaScript code snippet fetches a random quote from the Quotable API and displays it on a webpage. Upon loading the page, it sends a request to the API, retrieves a random quote along with the author's name, and updates the webpage elements to display the quote and the author. The code makes use of the fetch API to handle the network request and employs promise chaining to process the response. If an error occurs during the fetch operation, it is caught and logged to the console. This project provides a simple example of how to integrate external APIs into a web application to dynamically update content.
